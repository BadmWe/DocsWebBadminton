## What it Does

Web Badminton DApp is a decentralized application that serves as an educational platform for Badminton enthusiasts. Additionally, it includes an item store to manage and ledger the delivery of badminton equipment. The key features include:

- Equipment Ledgering: Real badminton equipment items are ledgered through digital counterparts using smart contract logic. The system determines demand and tracks each item. Upon completion of delivery, the DApp exchanges ERC1155 NFTs for the physical items.

- Cost Savings: The platform offers potential cost savings for producers by improving inventory tracking and demand management.

- Reliability: Unlike off-chain software ledgering systems that may face service interruptions, require updates, or risk data losses, Web Badminton DApp provides a reliable and low-cost business systems management solution.

- Minimal Additional Costs: The DApp incurs minimal additional costs, primarily related to new contract deployments for batches of items. These deployments occur every few months based on demand and delivery schedules.

- Decentralized Newsletter Subscription: A decentralized newsletter subscription list is integrated and connected to web3.storage, enhancing the overall decentralized nature of the platform.
