## Architecture

### Smart Contracts

TradeCoin utilizes Solidity smart contracts for the exchange of tokens. These contracts play a vital role in facilitating secure and automated token swaps.

### User Interface (Nextjs)

The user interface is built using the Nextjs framework, providing end-users with a decentralized application (dApp) to interact with the TradeCoin protocol. It ensures a user-friendly experience.
