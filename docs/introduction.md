## Introduction

### Project description

TradeCoin is a decentralized protocol designed for automated token exchange on Mina-compatible blockchains. It offers users the ability to securely and transparently exchange tokens in a trustless and permissionless manner. This protocol aims to make it easier for users to access liquidity and engage in secure and private token trading.

### Purpose and Goals

The primary goal of TradeCoin is to make token trading more accessible, secure, and private for users. It aims to provide liquidity to other projects and protocols, helping them access the necessary resources to grow and scale.

### Project Architecture

TradeCoin leverages a combination of technologies to provide its functionality:

- Solidity Smart Contracts: Smart contracts are used to facilitate the secure exchange of tokens on the blockchain, ensuring trustlessness and reliability in the trading process.

- React Framework Nextjs: Nextjs serves as the frontend for TradeCoin, providing users with a decentralized application (dApp) through which they can interact with the protocol.
